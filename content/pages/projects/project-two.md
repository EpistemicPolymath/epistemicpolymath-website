  I started Streaming in 2019 and it quickly became a passion of mine that I
  prioritize heavily. I am constantly researching new ways to improve my stream
  or increase my knowledge surrounding OBS Studio and plugins, FireBot, VACs,
  Audio devices and technologies, Video technologies, and more. I want to
  improve my stream as much as I possibly can and I love connecting with my
  supporters and having very in-depth conversations.
